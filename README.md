    <td>
      BALDES (pronounced /'baw-d…®s/) is a C++ implementation of a Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm designed to solve the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RCSPP), commonly used as a subproblem in state-of-the-art Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithms for various Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


The algorithm is based on state-of-the-art RCESPP techniques, including interior point stabilization, limited memory subset row cuts, clustering branching, and the so called bucket graph labelling.

## üìù Overview

The Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm organizes labels into **buckets** based on vertex and resource consumption intervals. This structure reduces the number of dominance checks, making the algorithm highly efficient, particularly in large VRP instances with extensive resource constraints.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Bucket Graph Organization:** Grouping labels by vertex and resource consumption to minimize dominance checks, using n-dimensional Splay Trees to keep the most acessed buckets easier to reach.
- **Parallel Bi-Directional Labeling:** Supports paralell forward and backward search strategies.
- **Dominance Rules:** Efficient dominance checks using resource-based comparisons and integration of additional criteria from Limited-Memory Subset Row Cuts (SRCs) for enhanced speed.
- **Multi-phase solving:** Out-of-the-box multi-phase solving that begins with heuristics and dynamically guides the algorithm towards an exact solution.
- **Good initial solutions** Utilizes the state-of-the-art [HGS-VRPTW](https://github.com/ortec/euro-neurips-vrp-2022-quickstart) algorithm to generate high-quality initial bounds and routes, an extension of the [HGS-CVRP](https://github.com/vidalt/HGS-CVRP) method employed by the ORTEC team to win the VRPTW track at the DIMACS Implementation Challenge. We also enchanced the HGS-VRPTW with the concepts proposed in [MDM-HGS-CVRP](https://github.com/marcelorhmaia/MDM-HGS-CVRP/), resulting in what we call the **MDM-HGS-VRPTW**.
- **Multi-stage branching**: Perform a multi-stage branching, including the recent cluster branching.
- **Improvement Heuristics:** Optional fast improvement heuristics are applied at the end of each labeling phase to enhance label quality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Some features are experimental and subject to ongoing improvements:

- **[experimental]** Knapsack Completion Bounds for Capacity Constraints
- **[experimental]** Branching (Branch-Cut-and-Price) for the VRPTW

## üìã TODO

- [x] Consider branching constraints duals
- [x] Improve branching decisions
- [ ] Refactor high order SRC cuts

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

**Resource Disposability Definition**

To control how each resource is treated (whether disposable, non-disposable, or binary), define the disposability type for each resource in the `BucketOptions` struct. Each position in the `resource_disposability` vector corresponds to a specific resource and should be assigned a value of `0`, `1`, or `2` to indicate the disposability type:

- **0**: Disposable resource ‚Äì the resource can be consumed or reset during the routing process.
- **1**: Non-disposable resource ‚Äì the resource is conserved and cannot be disposed of.
- **2**: Binary resource ‚Äì the resource toggles between two states (e.g., `0` for off and `1` for on).

Example configuration:

```cpp
struct BucketOptions {
    int depot                   = 0;
    int end_depot               = N_SIZE - 1;
    int max_path_size           = N_SIZE / 2;
    int main_resources          = 1;
    std::vector<std::string> resources = {"time", "capacity"};
    std::vector<int> resource_disposability = {1, 1}; // 1=disposable, 0=non-disposable
    std::vector<int> or_resources = {1};
};
```

In this example:
- **"time"** is treated as a disposable resource (`0`).
- **"capacity"** is treated as a non-disposable resource (`1`).

**TUI**

If you prefer, you can run the configurer tool, which provides a TUI for configuring BALDES.

```sh
./configurer.sh
```

## üìÇ Input File Format

The input file should specify the number of nodes, time horizon, vehicle capacities, and other VRP constraints.  
See examples in the `examples/` directory.

### üöÄ Running the Example Algorithm

To run Solomon-like instances:

```bash
./baldes vrptw ../examples/C203.txt
```

To run CVRP-like instance like the 10k instance proposed by [Uchoa et al.](http://vrp.galgos.inf.puc-rio.br/media/com_vrp/instances/Vrp-Set-XML100.zip).


```bash
./baldes cvrp ../examples/XML100_1111_01.vrp
```


### üêç Python Wrapper

We also provide a Python wrapper, which can be used to instantiate the bucket graph labeling:

```python
import random

# Now you can import the BALDES module
import pybaldes as baldes

# Define nodes
nodes = [baldes.VRPNode() for _ in range(102)]
num_intervals = 1

# Set random bounds for each node
id = 0
for node in nodes:
    node.lb = [random.randint(0, 9000) for _ in range(num_intervals)]  # Set random lower bounds
    node.ub = [random.randint(lb + 1, 10000) for lb in node.lb]  # Set random upper bounds greater than lb
    node.duration = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random duration
    node.cost = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random cost
    node.start_time = random.randint(0, 10000)  # Set random start time
    node.end_time = random.randint(node.start_time, 10000)  # Set random end time greater than start time
    node.demand = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random demand
    node.consumption = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(num_intervals)]  # Set random consumption
    node.set_location(random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))  # Set random location
    node.id = id
    id += 1

# Create fake distance matrix with size equal to the number of nodes
distances = [[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(len(nodes))] for _ in range(len(nodes))]

# Initialize BucketGraph using these nodes
bg = baldes.BucketGraph(nodes, 12000, 1)

# Create random duals with size equal to the number of nodes
duals = [random.random() for _ in range(len(nodes))]

# Set the distance matrix, adjacency list, and duals
bg.set_distance_matrix(distances)
bg.set_adjacency_list()
bg.set_duals(duals)
bg.setup()

# Call the solve method
labels = bg.solve()
```
